        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Michael Murphy, a passionate computer science major that is pursuing a degree at the University of Delaware. 
            Ever since I was a frehsman in high school I have been fascinated by the world of techology. I began my programming journey at a young age 
            which allowed me to build a strong foundation in various programming languages. As I moved on to college I was able to gain more experience
            in Java and Python aswell as learning new languages such as C++. I also gained experience in building websites using HTML, CSS, and Typescript.
            Through my software engineering classes I was able to learn proper version control while working with a team on a project. This allowed me to
            learn more about the general software developemnt lifecycle. This past semester I have been learning to use R for when working with statisics.
            I have also began using SQL in my databases class which I have found a strong interest in. Backend developement is something I plan on studying more
            as I move on pursuing my degree in computer science.</p>
